## Assignment

**AGOL Web App & Story Map**

**Due: Tue, July 6th (11:59pm)**

**Overview of the assignment:** Students will create two AGOL Applications, 1) a Story Map and 2) a Web App. 

1. StoryMap: Students can choose to use either a configured StoryMap template or use Storybuilder
   - Configured Story Map: From web map information page click Create Web App > Configurable Apps > StoryMap. 
   - StoryBuilder: storymaps.arcgis.com 
2. WebApp: Students can choose to use a Configured App or use the Web App Builder
   - Configurable app: Create Web App > Configurable App. Do not select a StoryMap template. 
   - Web App Builder: From web map information page click Create Web App Web App Builder. 

The purpose of this homework is not to be laborious, but to allow students to explore both tools before creating their AGOL Project.   

**Deliverable:** Project log with URLs to application and story map, including the following information: 

1. Story Map:
     - In the project log, explain which template (Configurable App or StoryBuilder Quick Start) you chose, or why you chose to build from “scratch”. (Brief, 1-2 sentences)
     - Story Map must include: 
	 1. At least one web map 
	 2. At least one immersive section. For the purposes of this homework, “immersive section” includes: 
	    - If using StoryBuilder from scratch, use Block Palette Immersive Section options: Slideshow, SideCacar, and Map tour 
	    - If using StoryBuilder Quickstart, Sidecar, Guided map tour, and explorer map tour works. 
	    - If using configurable apps: Cascade Template uses an immersive section, Story Builder uses SideCar. You should be able to add immersive sections in the other configurable apps, but your options might be limited.   
  	 3. Have some narrative text (1-2 paragraphs) 
	 4. At least one additional media content (image, video, etc) 

2. Web App: 
   -In the project log:
   	- Indicate either the Theme Selected or the Preconfigured App Template selected and why. (Brief, 1-2 sentences)
  	- Describe what widgets were used and how they help the user of your application understand/interact with your map. (Brief, 1-2 sentences)
   - Web App must include: 
   - Include at least two off-panel widgets interacting with map (Off-panel = widgets that did not come pre-loaded with the theme or template.)  

Projects will be scored on the inclusion of the above criteria, plus:
	- Screen-shots of important features & final map. 
	- Well-organized data
	- Clear, useful pop-ups
	- Meaningful title 
	- Understandable legend
	- Simple, purposeful cartography
	- Overview Page including:
	- Descriptive text providing context, summarizing the purpose of the map, and explaining its components. 
	- Credits/source information
