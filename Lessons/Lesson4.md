## Project 1

**Due: Tue, July 13th (11:59pm)** 

There are a lot of options in AGOL.  The purpose of this project is to choose one and create a detailed, in-depth web application, story map, or dashboard. Ideally, you could use this project for your final portfolio, so consider who you would want to share it with post-graduation.  

Students should be prepared to give a 2–3-minute demonstration of their application at the beginning of the July 14 class. How do you intend for users to interact with the application? Why did you choose this application format?  If you are unable to attend the class on July 14, please contact the instructor as soon as possible.   

If you have an AGOL project in mind that does not fit one of the below options, contact the instructor for guidance. 

**Option 1: Expand on your HW2 Story Map**
- Final product must be a story that bridges narrative text, spatial data, and media to tell a complicated story in an appealing, logical way. 
- Each project will vary greatly, so the following are not strict requirements, but rather general features to allow students to understand the scope expected. The student is encouraged to make choices that will either exclude or expand on the below in a way that suit the narrative of their story:  
  - Three separate map views (views from multiple web maps preferred)
  - 3-5 paragraphs narrative text
  - 2-3 additional media items (image, video, etc) 

*Option 1 Deliverables:* 

- Document uploaded to blackboard, including:
  - URL to Story Map, 
  - Screen shot of story map when webpage loads
  - Screen shots of major features
  - 1-2 paragraphs describing why you selected a StoryMap for your project. What were you trying to show and why was a StoryMap a better option?
    - Include why you selected the template/built from scratch & what immersive section you selected.  
    - What were some issues you came across?  
    - If choosing to include fewer items than listed above, describe why adding that content would have been detrimental to your final product. 

**Option 2: Expand on your HW2 Web Application**
- Final product must be a web mapping application that allows the viewer to sort through & comprehend otherwise noisy, complicated spatial data. The application must demonstrate a clear purpose and be easy-to-use for the intended audience. 
- Each project will vary greatly, so the following are not strict requirements, but rather general features to allow students to understand the scope expected. The student is encouraged to make choices that will either exclude or expand on the below in a way that suit the functionality of their application:   
  - Three off-panel widgets (widgets selected must make sense to overall functionality of application. Do not add widgets to simply add widgets)
  - 3-4 layers of data (points/line/polygon layers) that the user can interact with. (layers must make sense to the purpose and contextualize the problem at hand. Be wary of adding data that will only add unnecessary noise for the viewer)

*Option2 Deliverables:* 
- Document uploaded to blackboard, including:
  - URL to application, 
  - Screen shot of app when webpage loads
  - Screen shots of major features
  - 1-2 paragraphs describing why you selected an application for your project. What were you trying to accomplish and why was the application a better option?
    - What widgets you selected, and how the widgets make sense to the overall functionality of the application. 
    - Which data layers were selected and why?
    - What were some issues you came across?  
    - If choosing to include fewer items than listed above, describe why adding that content would have been detrimental to your final product. 

**Option 3: Survey 123 Map & Dashboard Application**

bjective: Learn the basics of creating a Survey 123 map, sharing, and embedding it in a Web App (Dashboard)  Ensure that your survey form, web map, and web app are all shared to the group, organization, or shared with everyone.  
Your dashboard should have at least 4 elements:
1.	Your survey 
2.	Web Map showing survey results
3.	Two additional dashboard elements showing the results of the survey (charts, graphs, etc) 

*Option 3 Deliverables: Document uploaded to blackboard, including:*
1.	URL to application, 
2.	Screen shot of app when webpage loads
3.	Screen shots of major features
4.	1-2 paragraphs describing why you selected the survey & dashboard. 


**Project 1 will be scored on the inclusion of the above criteria, plus:**
- Well-organized data
- Clear, useful pop-ups
- Meaningful title 
- Understandable legend
- Simple, purposeful cartography
- AGOL Overview Page of application must include:
  - Descriptive text providing context, summarizing the purpose of the map, and explaining its components. 
  - Credits/source information 

## Extra Credit

**For extra credit: Learn the basics of Open Street Mapping, Humanitarian OpenStreet Map Team, and how to contribute to projects.**  
 
1.	Log into the HOT OSM Tasking Manager & create OSM ID https://tasks.hotosm.org/
2.	Choose a project – it must be a beginner task, and should be less than 90% completed
3.	Read through ALL INSTRUCTIONS for the project
4.	Map one tile using the HOT editor of your choice. 
5.	When in doubt, see step-by-step instructions: https://learnosm.org/en/coordination/tasking-manager3/ 

**Extra Credit Deliverables: In you project log, submit a 1-2 paragraph summary to blackboard, including:**
- Your OSM ID and link to completed tasks in editor system.
- 1-2 sentences describing project, why HOT was needed, and the tasks you accomplished.

**Each submitted tile will be worth 2 points, for up to 10 points. Open until 8/4**
- If tiles come from separate projects, include a description for each
- Indicate the number of tiles completed in the log
- If you already submitted the extra credit and decide to complete more tiles, add the additional info to your document and resubmit to blackboard.
