## Project 2

**Adding & Manipulating GeoJSON Data with Leaflet & JavaScript**

**Due:  August 4, 6pm**

**Objective:** 
- ontinue working with Leaflet & JavaScript by adding & manipulating GeoJSON data.  Final product will be a detailed, interactive Leaflet map.  
- I have uploaded the JavaScript code covered in the class repository [*here.*](https://github.com/shelleyhoover/upp465example/tree/master/week6)
  - Index.html has my final leaflet map for reference. While I expect you to reference it, do not copy/paste
from my file to yours. Take the time to rewrite the code and make it your own, it will help you understand
how it all works together.
