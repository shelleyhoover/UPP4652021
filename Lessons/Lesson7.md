## Project 2

**Adding & Manipulating GeoJSON Data with Leaflet & JavaScript**

**Due:  August 4, 6pm**

**Objective:** 
- Continue working with Leaflet & JavaScript by adding & manipulating GeoJSON data.  Final product will be a detailed, interactive Leaflet map.  
- I have uploaded the JavaScript code covered in the class repository [*here.*](https://github.com/shelleyhoover/upp465example/tree/master/week7)
  - Index.html has my final leaflet map for reference. While I expect you to reference it, do not copy/paste
from my file to yours. Take the time to rewrite the code and make it your own, it will help you understand
how it all works together.

**Deliverables:** 
2-minute overview of your map during Week 8's Class
Document uploaded to blackboard including: 
- Link to github webpage  [Example](https://shelleyhoover.github.io/upp465example/)
- Link to github project repository [Example](https://github.com/shelleyhoover/upp465example)
- Screenshot of final webpage

**Website should have:** 
- Title & Introductory text to map (be sure this makes sense with whatever data you are using) 
- Leaflet map, including:
  - Tile Layer (Basemap)  
  - At least one GeoJSON file
  - GeoJSON styling should have a conditional element (if/else) 
  	- If you add multiple GeoJSON files, only one file requires the conditional style.  
  - Add pop-ups for GeoJSON

**Github Repository should have:**
- README file introducing project (add additional info from HW3)
- HTML File
- CSS File
