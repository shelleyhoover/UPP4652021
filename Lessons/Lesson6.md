## Assignment

**Add a Leaflet Map to your Webpage**

**Due:  July 27, 11:59pm**

**Objective:** 
- Use JavaScript and Leaflet.js to add a map with some basic geometry (points, lines, and
or polygons) to your webpage.
- Have fun with this exercise! There are a lot of JavaScript principles utilized in this assignment. I want you to have a general idea of what is going on, but I do not expect you have a full grasp of all the concepts
after one lecture on JS/Leaflet! The purpose of this assignment is for you to get used to playing
around/exploring Leaflet. Do not be afraid to break things while youâ€™re figuring out how to get a Leaflet
map online.
- The geometry features & their popups on this homework can be silly/random. We will be using different
data for the final project. The final project will include more complicated datasets & data manipulation. 
- I have uploaded the JavaScript code covered in the class repository [here.](https://github.com/shelleyhoover/upp465example/tree/JavaScript-Examples)
  - Index.html has my final leaflet map for reference. While I expect you to reference it, do not copy/paste
from my file to yours. Take the time to rewrite the code and make it your own, it will help you understand
how it all works together.

**Website should have:** 
- Introductory text to map (can be same as HW3)
- Leaflet map with tile layer & geometry features added: points (marker or circle), lines, and or
polygons.
  - Add at least four features
  - At least one of each type (point, line, and polygon)
  - Style each feature (Except markers, you can leave the default Leaflet styling.)
  - Add pop-ups for each feature

**Github Repository should have:**
- README file introducing project (add additional info from HW3)
- HTML File
- CSS File
